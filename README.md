[RVA] (http://rva.risevision.com) is the digital signage management application for the [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com) platform.

The RVA is run on, and as such requires, Google App Engine, and it was built with the Google Web ToolKit framework, so that plug-in is required as well.

And if you are considering contributing to this open source project, our favourite option, we have 3 good reasons why we released this code under version 3 of the GNU General Public License, and we think they are 3 good reasons for why you should get involved too:

1. Together we can make something far better than we could on our own.

2. If you want to use our code to make something that is specific to you, and that doesn’t fit with what we want to do, we don’t want to get in your way. Take our code and make just what you need.

3. We know that some of you nervous types worry about what happens if our company gets taken out in the zombie apocalypse. We get it, and neither one of us wants to deal with that delicate question of software escrow agreements for the “just in case we kick the bucket scenario”. No worries! We made it easy. No fuss, no cost, no lawyers! We published the software here. Have at it.

3 compelling reasons for why you should actively join our project. 

1. Together we can make something better than either of us could on our own. 

2. If you have something completely different in mind, no problem, take our code, fork it, and make what you need, but respect the open source movement, and our license, and keep it open. 

3. Become a zombie crusader!

Are we missing something? Something could be better? Jump in, branch our code, make what you want, and send us a Pull Request. If it fits for both of us then of course we will accept it, maybe with a tweak or two, test it, and deploy it. If it doesn’t fit, no worries, just fork our code and create your own specialized application for your specific needs. Or, if you’re just feeling paranoid, download the code, and put it under your mattress.

**Either way, welcome to our project!**
